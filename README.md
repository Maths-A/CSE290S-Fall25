# Description

This graduate seminar will explore distributed systems research, both current and historical, with a particular focus on storage systems and programming models.

Due to fundamental uncertainty in their executions arising from asynchronous communication and partial failure, distributed systems present unique challenges to programmers and users.  Moreover, distributed systems are increasingly ubiquitous: nearly all non-trivial systems are now physically distributed.  

A great deal of theoretical work in distributed systems establishes important impossibility results, including the famous FLP result, the CAP Theorem, the two generals problem and the impossibility of establishing common knowledge via protocol.  These results tell us what we *cannot* achieve, or more constructively, tell us about the properties we must trade off for the properties we require when designing or using large-scale systems.  But what *can* we achieve?  The history of applied distributed systems work is largely the history of infrastructures -- storage systems as well as programming models -- that attempt to manage the complexity with abstractions.
