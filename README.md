# Description

This graduate seminar will explore distributed systems research, both current and historical, with a particular focus on storage systems and programming models.

Due to fundamental uncertainty in their executions arising from asynchronous communication and partial failure, distributed systems present unique challenges to programmers and users.  Moreover, distributed systems are increasingly ubiquitous: nearly all non-trivial systems are now physically distributed.  It is no longer possible to relegate responsibility for managing the complexity of distributed systems to a group of expert library or infrastructure writers: all programmers must now be distributed programmers. This is both a crisis and an opportunity.

A great deal of theoretical work in distributed systems establishes important impossibility results, including the famous FLP result, the CAP Theorem, the two generals problem and the impossibility of establishing common knowledge via protocol.  These results tell us what we *cannot* achieve in a distributed system, or more constructively, they tell us about the properties we must trade off for the properties we require when designing or using large-scale systems.  But what *can* we achieve?  The history of applied distributed systems work is largely the history of infrastructures -- storage systems as well as programming models -- that attempt to manage the complexity with abstractions.  

This course focuses on these systems, models and languages.  We will cover the following topics:
 
 * Consistency models
 * Fault-tolerant design
 * Issues related to programmability
 * 
 
# Readings

This course is a research seminar: we will focus primarily on reading and discussion conference papers.  We will read 1-2 papers (typically 2) per session; for each paper, you will provide a brief summary (about 1 page).  The summary should answer some or all of the following questions:

 * What problem does the paper solve?  Is is important?
 * How does it solve the problem? 
 * What alternative approaches are there? Are they adequately discussed in the reading?
 * What research questions does the paper raise?
 *
